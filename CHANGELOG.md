## Problem
- When i try to update the current round, the round is not updated in the tournament (in database )

- Example usage 
    - Supose we have a tournament with 3 rounds, 4 players, curent_id_round = 0
    - Suppose we have defaults score results at -1
    - Supose we have a new_res to push
    - t.update_current_round(new_res) => no update in the tournament DATABASE

    -  the proble is here : ```t.update_current_round(new_res)```   

## Todo

- Start Front app / views and Controlers 
- Write print  functions to display the  menu / option how to read user input to store values for players in a dict
