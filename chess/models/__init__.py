# the presence of __init__ signifies to Python
# that the directory should be considered
# a Python package, allowing you to import modules
# or sub-packages from that directory.


# THINK OOP

# Each object is a class ==> class is a blueprint for creating objects
# Each object has attributes and methods
# Attributes are variables that store data

# there is a strong relashionship  betweeen the
# class and his atributtes AND the databased
# the class is here as a blueprint for the database
# all logical, functionnal code "metier code" is in the data classes
# PLEASE Note that this paradigm is not the only one,
# but it is the most used in the industry
# (HERE FOR PEDAGOCIACL CONSIDERATION)
