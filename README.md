# Chess Tournament Management Software

## Introduction

As a junior developer with two months of experience, I've been working as a freelancer to assist local 
businesses in managing their inventory through simple scripts. Elie, a fellow Python developer and friend, 
approached me with a request to develop a chess tournament management software for the local chess club. 
Currently, the club organizes tournaments manually, and they are looking for an efficient and cost-effective solution.
